Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Dan and I am a computational materials chemist, currently based in the chemistry department of UCL within the group of [Prof. David Scanon](www.davidscanlon.com). Previously, I carried out [my PhD](https://dandavies99.github.io/files/my_thesis.pdf) under the supervision of [Prof. Aron Walsh](https://wmd-group.github.io) then was awarded a [Doctoral Prize Fellowship](https://epsrc.ukri.org/skills/students/dta/doctoralprize/) at Imperial College London. 

About my Research
======
My research focuses on the discovery of new inorganic materials for clean energy applications. The basic workflow of a typical study is usually along the lines of: 1. generate a sensible, and often very large, search space of hypothetical compositions or compounds (see the [SMACT](https://github.com/wmd-group/smact) code) 2. Use chemical heuristics, machine learning, or other data-driven filters to go through the search spaces and suggest top candidates 3. subject these top candidates to accurate first-principles methods to predict their properties.

A lot of my work has involved developing new codes and models that can be used at each stage of the workflow. The challenge I find most interesting is trying to predict likely and stable compounds for given chemical compositions. I have also been fortunate to collaborate with many experimental groups who can make our imagined compounds with awesome properties a reality. 

Please take a look at my [publications page](https://dandavies99.github.io/publications/) for more details on the kind of research I do. You can also find my PhD thesis on _"Materials discovery using chemical heuristics and high-throughput calculations"_ [here](https://dandavies99.github.io/files/my_thesis.pdf).
