Liionsden is a Django webapp that allows users to upload and store data from battery cycler experiments, and then perform analysis on the data. It is designed to be used by researchers in the field of Li-ion battery materials, and is currently being developed in collaboration with the Imperial College London [Electrochemical Science and Engineering Group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrochem-sci-eng) and the [Faraday Institution](https://www.faraday.ac.uk/).

The repository is currently private, but will be made public before the project is complete. If you are interested in using the webapp, please get in touch. A demo version is running on Azure, and can be accessed [here](https://liionsden.azurewebsites.net/).
