[SupraShare](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/suprashare) is a template repository for creating [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) apps to easily share trained machine learning (ML) models. It was developed in collaboration with [Prof. Kim Jelfs](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/k.jelfs) at the [Department of Chemistry](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/chemistry) at Imperial College London and is currently being used to host a number of models developed by the group. The apps are hosted on a College virtual machine [here](https://suprashare.rcs.ic.ac.uk/).

The template repository is easily customisable to allow users to create apps for newly published ML models, which may require a range of different input/output types. This allows users with little or no programming experience to interact with ML models in a simple and intuitive way, without having to worry about the underlying code.
