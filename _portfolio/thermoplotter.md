[Thermoplotter](https://github.com/SMTG-UCL/ThermoPlotter) was initially conceived of replace a collection of scripts used to produce plots from complex first-principles calculations data. Now, it is a streamlined package that makes it easy to analyse raw data and convert it into publication-quality plots. Take a look at the gallery [here](https://smtg-ucl.github.io/ThermoPlotter/gallery.html).

The code is focused on the analysis of properties for thermoelectric materials, so interfaces with the [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/) DFT code, as well as other specialst codes for phonon analysis.
