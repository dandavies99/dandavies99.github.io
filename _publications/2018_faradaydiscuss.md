[Faraday Discussions](https://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/about-journals/faraday-discussions/) are a unique format of meeting whereby authors present an overview of a pre-submitted paper and a general discussion follows that is recorded and published alongside the original work. This is the general discussion that followed presentation of [our work on oxidation states](https://dandavies99.github.com/publication/2018_faradaydiscuss2) at an RSC Faraday Discussions meeting on structure prediction.
