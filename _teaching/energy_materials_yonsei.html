<p>I spent the Easter period of 2016, 2017 and 2019 at Yonsei University, running postraduate lectures and workshops on computational investigation of energy materials.</p>

<p>Each year, the course was led by <a href="https://wmd-group.github.io">Prof. Aron Walsh</a>, who introduced the necessary quantum chemistry theory and practical methods for first-principles calculations. I delivered lectures on data-driven methods, and practical hands-on python workshops.</p>

<p>The courses were intensive, delivered as 3 x 3 hour lectures a week for 3 weeks. As such, it was a unique challenge of stamina for students and teachers! Luckily, everyone rose to the challenge and the students were exceedingly driven, whis made for an extremely rewarding teaching experience.</p>

<p>Hats off to the other teachers of the course over the years, including <a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/w/lucy-whalley/">Lucy Whalley</a>, <a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/jonathan.skelton.html">Jonathan Skelton</a> and  <a href="https://www.samanthahood.com.au/">Samathan Hood</a>.</p>

<p>Below is an example presentation of mine from the 2017 course:</p>
