<p>As part of my role in the Research Software Engineering Team at Imperial College London, I deliver a course on software engineering best practices for researchers.</p>

<p>The course can be delivered both in person and remotely using <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a> approach and the course material is <a href="https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/grad_school_software_engineering_course/">available online.</a></p>

<p>The course introduces tools such as linters, formatters and package managers. It also highlights concepts such as data structures and unit testing.</p>
