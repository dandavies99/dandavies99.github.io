<p>Towards the end of my time as a PhD student in Bath I helped to deliver workshops on the role of data and databases in materials discovery.</p>

<p>This was part of the <a href="https://epsrc.ukri.org/skills/students/centres/2013-cdt-exercise/newandsustainablephotovoltaics/">EPSRC CDT in New and Sustainable Photovoltaics</a> so was centred around materials properties such as band gap and effective mass.</p>

<p>I put together several Jupyter notebooks for learning how to interact with various materials databases.</p>
