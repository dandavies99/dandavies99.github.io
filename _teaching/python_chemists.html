<p>At UCL I was involved in a new course which aimed to get final year chemistry students familiar with the rudiments of Python.</p>

<p>This involved holding 1:1 catch up sessions to check how individual projects were progressing, as well as running live, online demonstrations on a range of subjects including debugging code, handling errors and using Exceptions and Assertions correctly.</p>
