<p>Lab demonstrating during my time as a PhD student involved helping first and second year undergraduates get to grips with compchem fundamental such as geometry relaxation and forcefields.</p>

<p>There was also a FORTRAN programming course for final year chemists led by <a href="https://people.bath.ac.uk/chsscp/">Prof Steve Parker</a>. This was a challenging but highly rewarding course to be involved in, because it was most of the students' first exposure to programming. </p>
